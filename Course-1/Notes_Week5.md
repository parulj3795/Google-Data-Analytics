## Job of a data analyst

**Jobs in** Technology, Marketing, Finance, Healthcare, etc.

-   **Technology** relies on software and hardware to function.

-   **Marketing** uses audience insights to make decisions.

-   **Finance** relies on daily market trends for insight.

-   **Healthcare** involves reviewing hospital traffic to inform staff decisions.

-   **Hospitality** looks at seasonal trends to predict demand.

-   **Government** relies on demographic information in order to provide proper support.

## Fair Business Decisions

-   **Issue** - A topic or subject to investigate
-   **Question** - Design to discover information
-   **Problem** - An obstacle or complication that needs to be worked out

-   **Business Task** - The question or problem that data analysis answers for a business.

-   **Example** - Data Analysis task
    -   Business: Zoo
    -   Business Task: Analyze weather data from the last decade to identify predictable patterns
    -   Job of Data Analyst: To gather, analyze, and present the data needed to solve the task. 
    -   Solution: Using the data the zoo would be able to make informed decision for their daily staffing. 

- Ensuring that analysis does not create or reinforce bias requires using processes and systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone. 

-   **Example** - Business Fairness
    -   Let's say we have a company that's kind of notorious for being a boys club. There isn't much representation of other genders. 
        -   This company wants to see which employees are doing well, so they start gathering data on employee performance and their own company culture. 
        -   The data shows that men are the only people succeeding at this company. 
        -   Conclusion - That they should hire more men. After all, they're doing really well here.
    
        But that's not a fair conclusion for a couple of reasons. 
    
        -   First, it doesn't even consider all of the available data on company culture, so it paints an incomplete picture. 
        -   Second, it doesn't think about the other surrounding factors that impact the data, or in other words, the conclusion doesn't consider the difficulties that people of different gender identities have trying to navigate a toxic work environment. 
    
        If the company only looks at this conclusion, they won't acknowledge and address how harmful their culture is and they won't understand why certain people are set up to fail within it. That's why it's important to keep fairness in mind when analyzing data. 
    
        The conclusion that only men are succeeding at this company is true, but it ignores other systematic factors that are contributing to this problem.

    -   A team of Harvard data scientists were developing a mobile platform to track patients at risk of cardiovascular disease in an area of the United States called the Stroke Belt. 
        -   It's important to call out that there were a variety of reasons people living in this area might be more at risk. With that in mind, these data scientists recognized that fairness needed to be a priority for this project, so they built fairness into their models. 
        -   The team took several fairness measures to make sure they were being as fair as possible when examining sensitive and potentially biased data. 
        -   First, they teamed analysts with social scientists who could provide insights on human bias and the social context that created them. 
        -   They also collected self reported data in a separate system to avoid the potential for racial bias, which might skew the results of their study and unfairly represent patients. 
        -   To make sure this sample population was representative, they oversampled non-dominant groups to ensure the model was including them. 
        -   It's clear that the team made fairness a top priority every step of the way. This helped them collect data and create conclusions that didn't negatively impact the communities they were studying.

## Case Study 1

To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.

At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. The data was collected via student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good). 

The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.

**Reflection**

*This is an example of unfair practice. It is tempting to conclude—as the administration did—that the workshop was a success. However, since the workshop was voluntary and not random, it is not appropriate to infer a causal relationship between attending the workshop and the higher rating.*

*The workshop might have been effective, but other explanations for the differences in the ratings cannot be ruled out. For example, another explanation could be that the staff volunteering for the workshop were the better, more motivated teachers. This group of teachers would be rated higher whether or not the workshop was effective.*

*It’s also notable that there is no direct connection between student survey responses and workshop attendance. The data analyst could correct this by asking for the teachers to be selected randomly to participate in the workshop. They could also collect data that measures something more directly related to workshop attendance, such as the success of a technique the teachers learned in that workshop.*

## Case Study 2

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. They carry out the tests on various types of roadways—specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.

The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.

They review the data after the initial tests. The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions. 

**Reflection**

*This case study shows an unfair practice. While the researchers test the prototype on three different tracks, they only conduct tests during the day.*

*Conditions on each track may be very different during the day and night and this could change the results significantly. The data analyst should correct this by asking the test team to add in nighttime testing to get a full perspective of how the prototype performs at any time of the day on the tracks.*

## Case Study 3

An amusement park plans to add new rides to their property. First, they need to determine what kinds of new rides visitors want the park to build. In order to understand their visitors’ interests, the park develops a survey. 

They decide to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the lines are long enough that visitors will have time to answer all of the questions. After collecting this survey data, they find that most of the respondents want more roller coasters at the park. They conclude that they should add more roller coasters, as most of their visitors prefer them.

**Reflection**

*This case study contains an unfair practice. While the decision to distribute surveys in places where visitors would have time to respond makes sense, it accidentally introduces sampling bias.*

*The only respondents to the survey are people waiting in line for the roller coasters. This may unfairly bias survey results, because respondents might prefer roller coasters. A data analyst could reduce sampling bias by distributing the survey at the entrance and exit of the amusement park. This would avoid targeting roller coaster fans and provide results from the park’s general audience.*
