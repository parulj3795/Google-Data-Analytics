* Analytical Skills are qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts. Main aspects 
    -   Curiosity: a desire to know more about something, asking the right questions
    -   Understanding context: understanding where information fits into the “big picture”
    -   Having a technical mindset: A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.
    -   Data design: organizing information
    -   Data strategy: Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis.

* Skills used by Data Analysts
    -   **Analytical skills** - The qualities and characteristics associated with solving problems using facts. Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner. Key aspects -
        -   Visualization: Graphical representation of information
        -   Strategy
        -   Problem-orientation
        -   Correlation
        -   Big-picture and detail-oriented thinking: To execute a plan using detail-oriented thinking, a data analyst considers the specifics. Big-picture thinking means seeing the big picture and the details.
    -   **A technical mindset** - The analytical skill that involves breaking processes down into smaller steps and working with them in an orderly, logical way
    -   **Data design** - The analytical skill that involves how you organize information
    -   **Understanding context** - The analytical skill that has to do with how you group things into categories
    -   **Data strategy** - The analytical skill that involves managing the processes and tools used in data analysis. High-level path needed to achieve the goals.

## Questions that a Data Analyst asks

* Ask "why?" five times to reveal the root cause of a problem. Example - 
    * I cannot make blueberry pie.
        -   Why? - Because there are no blueberries
        -   Why? - Because there are none at the store
        -   Why? - Because there were less number of fruits this year
        -   Why? - Because the birds ate the blue berries since there were no mulberries, which is their normal fruit
        -   Why? - Because of a late frost the mulberry trees didn't produce any fruit.

    Therefore, I cannot make a blueberry pie, because of a frost months ago!

* Where are the gaps in our process? 
    -   Gap Analysis: Gap analysis lets you examine and evaluate how a process works currently in order to get where you want to be in the future. Understand where you are now, compared to where you want to be.

* What did we not consider before?
    -   Figure out the information or procedure might be missing from a process.

## Data-driven Decision-making 

Using facts to guide business strategy. Example - 
-   Let's say the president of an organization is curious about what perks employees value most. She asked the human resources director who says people value casual dress code. It's a gut feeling, but the HR director backs it up with the fact that he sees a lot of people wearing jeans and t-shirts. But what if this company were to use a more structured employee feedback process, such as a survey? It might reveal that employees actually enjoy free public transportation cards the most. The human resources director just didn't realize that because he drives to work.


## Google Data Analysis example

The HR department wanted to know if there was value in having managers. Were their contributions worthwhile? Or should everyone just be an individual contributor? To answer that question, Google's people analytics team looked at past performance reviews and employee surveys. The data they found was plotted on a graph because as you've learned, visuals are extremely helpful when trying to understand a problem or concept. The graph revealed that Googlers had positive feelings about their managers, but the data was pretty general and the team wanted to learn more. So they dug deeper and split the data into quartiles. A quartile divides data points into four equal parts or quarters. Here's where the really cool stuff started happening. The data analysts discovered that there was a big difference between the very top and the very bottom quartiles. As it turned out, the teams with the best managers were significantly happier, more productive, and more likely to want to keep working at Google. This confirmed that managers were valued and make a big difference. Therefore, the idea of having only individual contributors was not implemented. But there was still more work to do. Just knowing that great managers create great results doesn't lead to actionable insights. You have to identify what exactly makes a great manager, so the team took two additional steps to collect more data. First, they launched an awards program where employees could nominate their favorite managers. For every submission you had to provide examples or data about what makes that manager great. The second step involved interviewing managers who were graphed on the top and bottom quartiles. This helped the analytics team see the differences between successful and less successful management behaviors. The best behaviors were identified as were the most common reasons for a manager needing improvement. The final step was sharing these insights and putting a procedure in place for evaluating managers with these qualities in mind. This data-driven decision continues to create an exceptional company culture for my colleagues and me.
