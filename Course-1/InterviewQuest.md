# Practice question after learning about data life cycle in Week 3

Discussing the data life cycle in a mock interview for a data analyst role. Then, you will respond to three brief questions. You’ve done the hard work to learn the basics of the data life cycle, so get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick! 

## Interview for a data analyst position

****

Imagine that you interview for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company. The hiring manager explains that the company needs a data analyst because they want to learn more about their customers. First, they want to understand their customers’ ice cream flavor preferences. Then, they will use this customer data to help make important decisions. 

The hiring manager explains that they do not collect any customer data, and they don’t know where to begin. The hiring manager asks you: Can you please explain how you would approach this task?

Before responding to the question, you consider each step of the data life cycle.
*   **Plan**: What plans and decisions do you need to make? What data do you need to answer your question?
*   **Capture**: Where does your data come from? How will you get it?
*    **Manage**: How will you store your data? What should it be used for? How do you keep this data secure and protected?
*    **Analyze**: How will the company analyze the data? What tools should they use?
*    **Archive**: What should they do with their data when it gets old? How do they know when it's time?
*    **Destroy**: Should they ever dispose of any data? If so, when and how?

Consider your learning about the steps of the data life cycle and reflect on the hiring manager’s request. Review the following questions to help guide your thinking: 

*   What kind of data should they gather? 
    *    The company needs to gather data that shows the number of people vs their preferred ice-cream flavor.
*   **How should they gather this data?** 
    *   The company can collect data in one of two ways - 
        1.  They can either take a survey of people directly asking them about their preferred ice-cream flavor.
        2.  Or they can keep a count of number of each flavors sold in a particular time period. 
    * **Coursera Answer -** 
         A good reflection on this topic would address that—to use their data successfully—the ice cream company must: 
        *  Figure out what data they need and where they can get it
        *    Collect the data, and be sure of what they will (and won’t) use it for.
        *   Consider how to secure the data and deal with old data that is no longer useful.

        As a data analyst, these are the types of questions you should always seek to answer about your data. From considering data collection before a project begins (in the plan phase) to removing data with data erasure software (in the destroy phase), data analysts must apply these concepts to effectively approach each data project.
*   Where will the data live? How will they store the data?
    * The company should invest in a database.
*   Once they have the data, how will they use it? 
    * They should hire a data analyst who can process the data and bring out the required result
*   How do they keep their data secure and protected? 
    * They shoudl not take any personal information, and must have a data security software.
*   What should they do with old data? What are their options?
    * The company should archive the data once the necessary results are found. This data should later be deleted if it's not in use for a long period.
