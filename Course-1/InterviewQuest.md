## Interview for a data analyst position

****

Imagine that you interview for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company. The hiring manager explains that the company needs a data analyst because they want to learn more about their customers. First, they want to understand their customers’ ice cream flavor preferences. Then, they will use this customer data to help make important decisions. 

The hiring manager explains that they do not collect any customer data, and they don’t know where to begin. The hiring manager asks you: Can you please explain how you would approach this task?
