# Week 1

* Understand the different types of data and data structures
* What type of data is right for the question you're answering
* Practical skills about how to extract, use, organise, and protect your data

## Data collection considerations
* How the data will be collected
* Choose data sources
* Decide what data to use
* How much data to collect
* Select the right data type 
* Determine the time frame

**First-Party Data** - Data collected by an individual or group using their own resources. Eg. 
- Data from an interview you conducted
- Data from a survey returned from 20 participants
- Data from questionnaires you got back from a group of workers

**Second-Party Data** - Data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold. Eg.
- Data you bought from a local data analytics firm’s customer profiles
- Demographic data collected by a university 
- Census data gathered by the federal government

**Third-Party Data** - Data collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly. 

**Population** - All possible data values in a certain dataset.

In instances when collecting data from an entire population is challenging, data analysts may choose to use a sample.

**Sample** - A part of a population that is representative of the population.

**Discrete Data** - Data that is counted and has a limited number of values. Eg.
- Number of people who visit a hospital on a daily basis (10, 20, 200)
- Room’s maximum capacity allowed
- Tickets sold in the current month

**Continuous Data** - Data that is measured and can have almost any numeric value. Eg.
- Height of kids in third grade classes (52.5 inches, 65.7 inches)
- Runtime markers in a video
- Temperature

**Nominal Data** - A type of qualitative data that is categorised without a set order. Eg.
- First time customer, returning customer, regular customer
- New job applicant, existing applicant, internal applicant
- New listing, reduced price listing, foreclosure

**Ordinal Data** - A type of qualitative data with set order or scale. Eg.
- Movie ratings (number of stars: 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars)
- Ranked-choice voting selections (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Income level (low income, middle income, high income)

**Internal Data** - Data that lives within a company's own systems. Eg.
- Wages of employees across different business units tracked by HR
- Sales data by store location 
- Product inventory levels across distribution centers

**External Data** - Data that lives and is generated outside of an organisation. External data is particularly valuable when an analysis depends on as many sources as possible. Eg.
- National average wages for the various positions throughout your organization
- Credit reports for customers of an auto dealership

**Structured Data** - Data organised in a certain format such as rows and columns. Eg. spreadsheets, relational database
- Expense reports
- Tax returns
- Store inventory

**Unstructured Data** - Data that is not organised in any easily identifiable manner.  Eg. audio files, video files
- Social media posts
- Emails
- Videos

The star rating is an example of ordinal data because the number of stars are in order of how much each person liked the movie. It’s also an example of discrete data because a person has to choose a full star measure; given that half-stars weren’t an option.


**Qualitative Data** - Subjective and explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics.
- Exercise activity most enjoyed
- Favorite brands of most loyal customers
- Fashion preferences of young adults

**Quantitative Data** - Specific and objective measures of numerical facts. 
- Percentage of board certified doctors who are women
- Population of elephants in Africa
- Distance from Earth to Mars

### Data Model
A model that is used for organising data elements and how they relate to one another.

### Data Elements
Pieces of information, such as people's names, account numbers, and addresses.

### What is data modeling?
Data modeling is the process of creating diagrams that visually represent how data is organized and structured.  These visual representations are called data models.

**Data Type** - A specific kind of data attribute that tells what kind of value the data is. For eg. Data types in a spreadsheet - Number, Text or String, Boolean

****

* When referring to spreadsheets - rows & columns. When talking about structured dataset, records & fields.

* Spreadsheets are powerful tools, allowing data analysts to make sense of large amounts of data with simple functions. The more comfortable you get with the different functions and features available in spreadsheets, the more quickly and effectively you’ll be able to clean, explore, process, and visualize data on the job!

**Wide Data** - data in which every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various attributes of the subject.

**Long Data** - data in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows.
