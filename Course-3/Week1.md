> Data collection considerations
* How the data will be collected
* Choose data sources
* Decide what data to use
* How much data to collect
* Select the right data type 
* Determine the time frame

**First-Party Data** - Data collected by an individual or group using their own resources. Eg. 
- Data from an interview you conducted
- Data from a survey returned from 20 participants
- Data from questionnaires you got back from a group of workers

**Second-Party Data** - Data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold. Eg.
- Data you bought from a local data analytics firm’s customer profiles
- Demographic data collected by a university 
- Census data gathered by the federal government

**Third-Party Data** - Data collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly. 

**Population** - All possible data values in a certain dataset.

In instances when collecting data from an entire population is challenging, data analysts may choose t  o use a sample.

**Sample** - A part of a population that is representative of the population.

**Discrete Data** - Data that is counted and has a limited number of values. Eg.
- Number of people who visit a hospital on a daily basis (10, 20, 200)
- Room’s maximum capacity allowed
- Tickets sold in the current month

**Continuous Data** - Data that is measured and can have almost any numeric value. Eg.
- Height of kids in third grade classes (52.5 inches, 65.7 inches)
- Runtime markers in a video
- Temperature

**Nominal Data** - A type of qualitative data that is categorised without a set order. Eg.
- First time customer, returning customer, regular customer
- New job applicant, existing applicant, internal applicant
- New listing, reduced price listing, foreclosure

**Ordinal Data** - A type of qualitative data with set order or scale. Eg.
- Movie ratings (number of stars: 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars)
- Ranked-choice voting selections (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Income level (low income, middle income, high income)

**Internal Data** - Data that lives within a company's own systems. Eg.
- Wages of employees across different business units tracked by HR
- Sales data by store location 
- Product inventory levels across distribution centers

**External Data** - Data that lives and is generated outside of an organisation. External data is particularly valuable when an analysis depends on as many sources as possible. Eg.
- National average wages for the various positions throughout your organization
- Credit reports for customers of an auto dealership

**Structured Data** - Data organised in a certain format such as rows and columns. Eg. spreadsheets, relational database
- Expense reports
- Tax returns
- Store inventory

**Unstructured Data** - Data that is not organised in any easily identifiable manner.  Eg. audio files, video files
- Social media posts
- Emails
- Videos

The star rating is an example of ordinal data because the number of stars are in order of how much each person liked the movie. It’s also an example of discrete data because a person has to choose a full star measure; given that half-stars weren’t an option.
