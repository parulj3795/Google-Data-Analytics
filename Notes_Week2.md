Explores different data sources to find out what they have in common.

**Algorithm** - A process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task

**Quantitative Data:** Specific and objective measures of numerical facts. The thing that can be measured. 
*   The What?

### Example of Qualitative and Quantitative data: 

**A business using data from customer reviews to see qualitative and quantitative data in action.**

 A local ice cream shop has started using their online reviews to engage with their customers and build their brand. These reviews give the ice cream shop insights into their customers' experiences, which they can use to inform their decision-making. The owner notices that their rating has been going down. He sees that lately his shop has been receiving more negative reviews. He wants to know why, so he starts asking questions. First are measurable questions. 
 *  How many negative reviews are there? 
 *  What's the average rating? 
 *  How many of these reviews use the same keywords? 
 
 These questions generate quantitative data, numerical results that help confirm their customers aren't satisfied. This data might lead them to ask different questions. 
 *  Why are customers unsatisfied? 
 *  How can we improve their experience? 
 
 These are questions that lead to qualitative data. After looking through the reviews, the ice cream shop owner sees a pattern, 17 of negative reviews use the word "frustrated." That's quantitative data. Now we can start collecting qualitative data by asking why this word is being repeated? He finds that customers are frustrated because the shop is running out of popular flavors before the end of the day. Knowing this, the ice cream shop can change its weekly order to make sure it has enough of what the customers want. With both quantitative and qualitative data, the ice cream shop owner was able to figure out his customers were unhappy and understand why. Having both types of data made it possible for him to make the right changes and improve his business.
