## Data-driven vs Data-inspired decisions

Explores different data sources to find out what they have in common.

**Algorithm** - A process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task

**Quantitative Data:** Specific and objective measures of numerical facts. The thing that can be measured. 
*   The What?
*   How many?
*   How often?

**Qualitative Data:** Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics. Eg. Hair color, Why certain people like some celebrities?, etc. Can't be measured.

### Example of Qualitative and Quantitative data: 

**A business using data from customer reviews to see qualitative and quantitative data in action.**

 A local ice cream shop has started using their online reviews to engage with their customers and build their brand. These reviews give the ice cream shop insights into their customers' experiences, which they can use to inform their decision-making. The owner notices that their rating has been going down. He sees that lately his shop has been receiving more negative reviews. He wants to know why, so he starts asking questions. First are measurable questions. 
 *  How many negative reviews are there? 
 *  What's the average rating? 
 *  How many of these reviews use the same keywords? 
 
 These questions generate quantitative data, numerical results that help confirm their customers aren't satisfied. This data might lead them to ask different questions. 
 *  Why are customers unsatisfied? 
 *  How can we improve their experience? 
 
 These are questions that lead to qualitative data. After looking through the reviews, the ice cream shop owner sees a pattern, 17 of negative reviews use the word "frustrated." That's quantitative data. Now we can start collecting qualitative data by asking why this word is being repeated? He finds that customers are frustrated because the shop is running out of popular flavors before the end of the day. Knowing this, the ice cream shop can change its weekly order to make sure it has enough of what the customers want. With both quantitative and qualitative data, the ice cream shop owner was able to figure out his customers were unhappy and understand why. Having both types of data made it possible for him to make the right changes and improve his business.

| **Report**    | **Dashboard** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically  | Monitors live, incoming data  |
| **Pros**  |
| High-level historical data | Dynamic, automatic, and interactive |
| Easy to design | More stakeholder access |
| Pre-cleaned and sorted data | Low-maintenance |
| **Cons** |
| Continual maintenance | Labor intensive design |
| Less visually appealing | Can be confusing |
| Static | Potentially uncleaned data |

*    A dashboard is a single point of access for managing a business's information. It allows analysts to pull key information from data in a quick review by visualizing the data in a way that makes findings easy to understand. 
*   Often, businesses will tailor a dashboard for a specific purpose. The three most common categories are:

    *   **Strategic:** focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics

    *   **Operational:** short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals

    *   **Analytical:** consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets

* How are the different types of dashboards similar to each other?
    *   Dashboards are visualizations: Visualizing data can be enormously useful for understanding and demonstrating what the data really means.
* In what ways do they differ?
    *   Dashboards identify metrics: Relevant metrics may help analysts assess company performance.

*  Dashboards can help companies perform many helpful tasks, such as:
    *   Track historical and current performance.
    *   Establish both long-term and/or short-term goals.
    *   Define key performance indicators or metrics.
    *   Identify potential issues or points of inefficiency.

    While almost every company can benefit in some way from using a dashboard, larger companies and companies with a wider range of products or services will likely benefit more. Companies operating in volatile, or swiftly changing markets like marketing, sales, and tech also tend to more quickly gain insights and make data-informed decisions.

**Pivot Table** - A pivot table is a data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, re-organize, group, count, total, or average data stored in a database. It allows its users to transform columns into rows and rows into columns.

**Metric** - Single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement.

*   ROI -  Return on Investment. Dependent upon the net profit over a period of time (metric 1) and the cost of investment (metric 2).

**Metric Goal** - A measureable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics. 

*   Small data - Excel Sheet
*   Big data - SQL
