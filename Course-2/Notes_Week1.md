# Week 1

*   Effective questions help in learning important insights about business problems.

*   Cleaning data is to transform raw data into a more usable format. It includes creating complete information and removing outliers.

*   Marketing analytics is the process of measuring, analyzing, and managing a company’s marketing strategy and budget. 

*   The target audience is the people the company is trying to reach. 

There are six data analysis phases that will help you make seamless decisions: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called **structured thinking**. This process involves four basic activities:

1.  Recognizing the current problem or situation
2.  Organizing available information 
3.  Revealing gaps and opportunities
4.  Identifying your options

**Step 1: Ask**

It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

*   Define the problem you’re trying to solve 
*   Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
*   Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
*   Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
*   Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

    *What are my stakeholders saying their problems are? Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?*

**Step 2: Prepare**

You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: 

*   What metrics to measure
*   Locate data in your database
*   Create security measures to protect that data

    *What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem? What research do I need to do?*

**Step 3: Process**

Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

*   Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data 
*   Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
*   Removing repeated entries
*   Checking as much as possible for bias in the data

    *What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve? How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?*

**Step 4: Analyze**

You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: 

*   Perform calculations
*   Combine data from multiple sources
*   Create tables with your results

    *What story is my data telling me? How will my data help me solve this problem? Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?*

**Step 5: Share**

Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:  

*   Make better decisions
*   Make more informed decisions
*   Lead to stronger outcomes
*   Successfully communicate your findings

    *How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand? What would help me understand this if I were the listener?*

**Step 6: Act**

Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

*How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?*

## Common type of problems that data analysts answer

1. Making predictions
    -   Using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future
    -   For eg. A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers. A data analyst can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.
2. Categorizing things
    -   Assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features
    -   For eg. A company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores.
3. Spotting something unusual
    -   Identifying data that is different from the norm
    -   For eg. A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.
4. Identifying themes
    -   Grouping categorized information into broader concepts
    -   For eg. User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. 

    By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

5. Discovering connections
    -   Finding similar challanges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them
    -   For eg. A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries. 
6. Finding patterns
    -   Using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again
    -   For eg. Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure. By analyzing maintenance data, the data analysts might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.

## SMART Questions

Questions should be open-ended. Things to avoid when asking questions -
-   Leading questions: questions that only have a particular response
-   Closed-ended questions: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only
-   Vague questions: questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

**Specific questions** are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas. For eg. ~~Are kids getting enough exercise these days?~~ What percentage of kids achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity at least 5 days a week?

**Measurable questions** can be quantified and assessed. For eg. ~~Why did our recent video go viral?~~ How many times was our video shared on social channels the week it was posted?

**Action-oriented questions** encourage change. For eg. ~~How can we get customers to recycle our product packaging?~~ What design features will make our packaging easier to recycle?

**Relevant questions** matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve. For eg. ~~Why does it matter that Pine Barrens tree frogs started disappearing?~~ What environmental factors changed in Durham, North Carolina, between 1983 to 2004 that could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear from Sandhills Region?

**Time-bound questions** specify the time to be studied. For eg. We need to study only the time range between 1983 to 2004 in the previous example. This limits the data, and makes the study more direct.

## Data Analyst Scenario

You are three weeks into your new job as a junior data analyst. The company you work for has just collected data on their weekend sales. Your manager asks you to perform a “deep dive” into this data. To get this project started, you must ask some questions and get some information.

Consider the scenario above:

*   Based on the SMART framework, which questions are most important to ask? 
    -   When is the project due?
    -   Are there any specific challenges to keep in mind? 
    -   Who are the major stakeholders for this project, and what do they expect this project to do for them?
    -   Who am I presenting the results to?

    -   **Objectives:** What are the goals of the deep dive? What, if any, questions are expected to be answered by this deep dive?
    -   **Audience:** Who are the stakeholders? Who is interested or concerned about the results of this deep dive? Who is the audience for the presentation?
    -   **Time:** What is the time frame for completion? By what date does this need to be done?
    -   **Resources:** What resources are available to accomplish the deep dive's goals?
    -   **Security:** Who should have access to the information?

*   How will these questions clarify the requirements and goals for the project?

    -   These questions can help you focus on techniques and analyses that produce results of interest to stakeholders. They also clarify the deliverable’s due date, which is important to know so you can manage your time effectively. When you start work on a project, you need to ask questions that align with the plan and the goals and help you explore the data. The more questions you ask, the more you learn about your data, and the more powerful your insights will be.

*   How does asking detailed, specific questions benefit you when planning for a project? Can vague or unclear questions harm a project?

    -   Asking thorough and specific questions means clarifying details until you get to concrete requirements. With clear requirements and goals, it’s much easier to plan and execute a successful data analysis project and avoid time-consuming problems down the road.
