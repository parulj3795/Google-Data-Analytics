# Week 4

> Communication is key

*  Project managers are responsible for planning and executing a project. These are the people you'd normally report to. They oversee the progress of entire team. 

* Executive team - The executive team provides strategic and operational leadership to the company. They set goals, develop strategy, and make sure that strategy is executed effectively. 

* Customer-facing team - The customer-facing team includes anyone in an organization who has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers. Typically they compile information, set expectations, and communicate customer feedback to other parts of the internal organization. 

* Data science team - Organizing data within a company takes teamwork. There's a good chance you'll find yourself working with other data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers.

> Focus and stay on the task

* Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders?
* Who is managing the data?
* Where can you go for help?

> Before you communicate with the rest of the team, think about

* Who your audience is
* What they already know
* What they need to know
* How you can communicate that effectively to them

These questions enable data scientists to communicate clearly with stakeholders and team members.

### Set realistic expectations at every step of the project
Setting expectations for a realistic timeline might involve sharing a high-level schedule with stakeholders, creating a schedule, and communicating clearly with team members.

> Best practices for good data storytelling:
* Compare the same types of data
* Visualize with care
* Leave out needless graphs
* Test for statistical significance
* Pay attention to sample size:

When leading a meeting, testing out technology, taking notes and preparing supporting materials will help you ensure all participants have a positive experience.
